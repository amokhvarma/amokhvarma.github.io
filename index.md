## WELCOME !!
I am Amokh and this is my personal website. I'm an Integrated Master's + Bachelor's student in the [Maths Department](https://maths.iitd.ac.in/drupal/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/). I am currently in my 4th year (joined 2018) . This website serves as a brief introduction to me and my interests. If you go over to the top right, you can see my CV and a brief description of my projects. Further, you can reach me using the email icon at the botom right. You can also find my github link there :) . Let's dive right in : 

## Academic Background
# Mtech in Maths and Computation
This will commence in 2022. 
### BTech in Maths and Computation
I joined college in 2018, having registerd for Electrical , Power and Automation Engineering. Very soon, I realised that its really not my cup of tea, especially when they introduced transformers and machines into the mix. At the end of my first year, I was able to apply for a branch change and join a 5 year intergrated maths degree. This has definitely been the best academic decision I have ever made . By the second year, I started developing a bit of interest in machine learning , probability and statistics. By my third semester, I did introductory courses in linear algebra and probability. Then, I started taking some machine learning courses one-by-one. In my 4th semester , I picked up introduction to machine learning. I learned basics of machine learning - like bayes' classifier, regressions, PAC-learning, SVM etc. I also attempted to hand code my own neural network and SVM , which was actually kind of mine. ( Might make a blog post for them later) For now, these projects can be found on my github.
